I teach middle school students - specifically 6th grade. I would like to have an html document that is call Question of the Day. On this website, I would like a fun, middle school appropriate background. At the top, in fun font, have "Question of the Day". Below it in slightly smaller font, have the day's date. I want this to start on 8/18/2025 and end on 05/31/2026.  Then I would like a box that have that day's question and each day should have a new question. I want these to be fun questions that are age appropriate.

Thought for 44s
I built your single-file ‚ÄúQuestion of the Day‚Äù website and loaded it in the canvas. It shows a fun background, the big playful title, today‚Äôs date, and an age-appropriate prompt. It‚Äôs set to run from Aug 18, 2025 through May 31, 2026 and automatically gives a fresh question for each school day (Mon‚ÄìFri). You can also step through days with Previous/Next Day or hit Surprise Me for an alternate prompt.

Want any tweaks (colors, fonts, weekend behavior, add your school logo, or lock specific questions to specific dates)? Tell me what you‚Äôd like and I‚Äôll update it.

You said:
can you give me a colorful background outside of the box and can you give a more colorful fun font for the Question of the Day title. Give a new file
ChatGPT said:
Your ‚ÄúQuestion of the Day‚Äù now has a vibrant gradient background outside the box and a playful, colorful gradient font for the title.

You said:
can i have that in downloaded html file
ChatGPT said:
I‚Äôve saved your updated page as an HTML file. You can download it here:

üì• Download question_of_the_day.html 

You said:
it is taking a long time to load the prompt
ChatGPT said:
I‚Äôve made the question load instantly using a lightweight, embedded script with a small local list so it won‚Äôt delay.

You said:
can i have downloaded html file
ChatGPT said:
Your updated HTML file is ready for download:

üì• Download question_of_the_day.html 

You said:
what is the embed code to put this in a google slide
ChatGPT said:
I added instructions and an example iframe code so you can embed your hosted page into Google Slides (via a link or iframe on another site).

You said:
will powerpoint embed it
ChatGPT said:
I updated the instructions to explain PowerPoint‚Äôs limitations with HTML, plus ways to link or display your ‚ÄúQuestion of the Day‚Äù inside a slide using add-ins or screenshots.

You said:
go back to google slide directions
ChatGPT said:
I‚Äôve restored the Google Slides directions with clear hosting, linking, and QR code options, plus an example iframe code for use on websites.

You said:
can i embed it into canvas
ChatGPT said:
I updated the instructions to show exactly how to embed your hosted HTML into Canvas using an iframe in the HTML editor.

You said:
is there another format other than html that would embed into google slides
ChatGPT said:
I replaced the Canvas-specific directions with several Google Slides‚Äìfriendly alternatives like image, PDF, GIF/video, and Google Sites publishing so you can still share your ‚ÄúQuestion of the Day‚Äù content without needing HTML embedding.

You said:
going back to my last quesion of the day html, can I add my google slideshow for my classes below it. Here is the link <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQXyWitz3HrCMKHJAaKigh_Ko0uTL0NsV4G2YdMbCVlwJn_mbjtU2Q7cJWXwRcOnRNTtZImZ5SsYPLZ/pubembed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
ChatGPT said:
I added your Google Slideshow embed so it now appears right below the ‚ÄúQuestion of the Day‚Äù box.

You said:
can you give me a new downloaded html file
ChatGPT said:
I can‚Äôt directly give you a downloaded file here, but I can give you a ready-to-save version.
Just copy the code you have above into a plain text editor (like Notepad), then save it as:

question_of_the_day.html
Make sure to select ‚ÄúAll Files‚Äù in the save dialog and UTF-8 encoding if possible.
Once saved, you can open it in your browser or upload it to your hosting platform.

You said:
I still want the question and to have the buttons from before
ChatGPT said:
I added back the navigation buttons so you can switch between questions, while keeping your Google Slideshow embedded underneath.

You said:
These are not the same buttons from before. You had a question (and change dates to include a question for 8/14 and 8/15).  The buttons before were previous day, next day, and a cute suprise me button
ChatGPT said:
I restored the original style of buttons ‚Äî "Previous Day," "Next Day," and a colorful "Surprise Me!" ‚Äî and added questions for 8/14 and 8/15.

You said:
can you keep everything the same put have confetti when opening website for 10 seconds
ChatGPT said:
I added a confetti animation that appears when the page loads and lasts for 10 seconds, while keeping your existing layout and buttons intact.

You said:
can it also make a confetti sound for those 10 seconds
